Also attached an updated fig 4 (there was a miscategorisation of phase (broad) for ref 24)

prefer not to capitalise mesenchymal stromal cells in the title.
done

the title of the paper should have more prominence
done

on tab 1, with "Differentiation" as the additional fill variable - the word "Differentiation" gets cut off in the legend
This was a insanely tricky! I had to completely remake my mental model of how different bits of technology talk to each other. But, ta da! Done

on tab 2, the test of association text at the bottom always appears as "classs" 
Done - The variable name is programmatic and pluralisation is inconsistent so wording changed to from "variablenames" to "variablename levels" 

on tab 2, displays with the categorical variable "indication class" don't display well: x-axis is overcrowded but there's no flip axes option on this tab
Done

tab 3: text above the second figure has "box" missing from "...The indicates ISCT markers"
Done

tab 4: should we add a note above the non-ISCT plot stating something like "these non-ISCT markers were reported by individual values;  absence of a marker here indicates no individual values were reported in any paper"
 - I don't follow how this applies only to the non-ISCT markers. I did add that to the info at the top

tab 5: the column headers for "Stem or Stromal" and "Donor Age" have capitals other than for the first word - to keep them consistent with the others can we lose the S and the A please?
Done

tab 5: "Other differentiation capacity" needs to be changed to "Other functionality assay" - don't need the word "type"
Done

I assume that changes made to the headers in the full data set (tab 5)will carry through to the other tabs?
Yes :)
